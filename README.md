This is my first C++ project — a basic scientific calculator that performs:

- Basic operations: +, -, ×, ÷
- Power, Square Root
- Natural Log, Exponential
- Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan

✅ Handles errors like division by zero and negative inputs 
🛠️ Written using basic C++ without OOP 
📚 Purpose: Educational practice and foundational understanding
